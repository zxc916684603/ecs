# Limits {#concept_gvb_h1w_tdb .concept}

This topic describes the limits on ECS product features and service performance and provides the method to apply for a higher quota.

When you use ECS, the following limits apply:

-   ECS does not support virtual application installation or revirtualization \(such as installation of VMware Workstation\). Currently, only [ECS Bare Metal Instance and Super Computing Clusters](reseller.en-US/Instances/Instance type families/ECS bare metal instance type family/ECS Bare Metal Instance.md#) support revirtualization.
-   ECS does not support sound card applications.
-   ECS does not support external hardware devices directly \(such as dongles, USB drives, or external hard drives\). Instead, it supports a software protection dongle or two-step verification with dynamic passwords.
-   ECS does not support IP address translation services such as SNAT. Instead, it supports a VPN or proxy.
-   ECS does not support multicast protocols. If multicasting services are required, we recommend that you use point-to-point unicast instead.
-   Currently, Log Service does not support 32-bit Linux ECS instances. For information about regions that support Log Service, see [Service endpoint](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/Service endpoint.md#). For information about operating systems that support Log Service, see [Overview](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Overview/Overview.md#).

In addition to the preceding limits, the following table details further limits of ECS and states whether you can open a ticket to request changing the limits.
